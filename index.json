Recently, researchers have proposed using wearable monitors during exposure assessment studies to obtain higher fidelity readings of exposures actually experienced by subjects. However, limited research has been conducted to link a wearer’s actions to periods of exposure, a necessary step for estimating inhaled dosage. To aid researchers in these settings, we developed a machine learning model for identifying periods of bicycling activity using passively collected data from the RTI MicroPEM wearable exposure monitor, a lightweight device capable of continuously sampling both air pollution levels and accelerometry parameters. Our best performing model identifies biking activity with a mean leave-one-session-out (LOSO) cross-validation F1 score of 0.832 (unweighted) and 0.979 (weighted). Accelerometer derived features contributed greatly to the model performance, as well as temporal smoothing of the predicted activities. Additionally, we found competitive activity recognition can occur with even relatively low sampling rates, suggesting suitability for exposure assessment studies where continuous data collection for long periods (without recharge) are needed to capture realistic daily routines and exposures.","tags":["human activity recognition","machine learning","wearable sensors","exposure assessment","air pollution"],"title":"Identification of Bicycling Periods Using the MicroPEM Personal Exposure Monitor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anupa Bir","Nikki Freeman","**Robert F Chew**","Kevin Smith","James Derzon","Timothy Day"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564977600,"objectID":"04e22a93ce7da76a43c2913a42f0dccd","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/bayes-meta-dash/","publishdate":"2019-08-05T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bayes-meta-dash/","section":"publication","summary":"The results of many large-scale federal or multi-site evaluations are typically compiled into long reports which end up sitting on policymaker’s shelves. Moreover, the information policymakers need from these reports is often buried in the report, may not be remembered, understood, or readily accessible to the policymaker when it is needed. This is not a new challenge for evaluators, and advances in statistical methodology, while they have created greater opportunities for insight, may compound the challenge by creating multiple lenses through which evidence can be viewed. The descriptive evidence from traditional frequentist models, while familiar, are frequently misunderstood, while newer Bayesian methods provide evidence which is intuitive, but less familiar. These methods are complementary but presenting both increases the amount of evidence stakeholders and policymakers may find useful. In response to these challenges, we developed an interactive dashboard that synthesizes quantitative and qualitative data and allows users to access the evidence they want, when they want it, allowing each user a customized, and customizable view into the data collected for one large-scale federal evaluation. This offers the opportunity for policymakers to select the specifics that are most relevant to them at any moment, and also apply their own risk tolerance to the probabilities of various outcomes.","tags":["health care innovation","data science","Bayesian","evidence","data visualization","Medicare","health services research","causal inference"],"title":"Making Evidence Actionable: Interactive Dashboards, Bayes, and Health Care Innovation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kasey Jones","**Robert F Chew**","Allison Witman","Yiyan Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564891200,"objectID":"61c063a17acc6e7976705368534a3d3e","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/rollmatch/","publishdate":"2019-08-04T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rollmatch/","section":"publication","summary":"The gold standard of experimental research is the randomized control trial. However, interventions are often implemented without a randomized control group for practical or ethical reasons.

Traditional PSM is not designed for studies that enroll participants on a rolling basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline and intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching (REM) is a new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects comparison members who are similar to intervention members with respect to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions) characteristics.

Poultry is one of the food commodities most frequently associated with Salmonella infections. While government, research, and industry efforts have reduced Salmonella contamination in poultry to some extent, the incidence of salmonellosis has not changed significantly and is still above the public health goals of Health People 2020, and novel and more comprehensive approaches are needed. In this paper, the public health impact of implementing different microbiological criteria (MC) for Salmonella in chicken parts was evaluated using a quantitative risk assessment approach. Four hypothetical scenarios, including a no-action baseline and three alternative scenarios, were considered. Scenario 1 modelled a prevalence-based microbiological criterion based on the proportion of positive samples in an establishment; Scenario 2 modelled a microbiological criterion based on the concentration of Salmonella in samples; and Scenario 3 modelled a combination of the two. With exception of the baseline, all three scenarios assumed that different interventions would be adopted for non-compliant establishments (Scenarios 1) or lots (Scenario 2), with Scenario 3 combining establishment-level and lot-level interventions. The product was assumed to be sold to consumer as raw, and contamination via undercooked product as well as cross contamination in consumer kitchens were considered as potential exposure routes. Risk was characterized by the probability of illness and the preventable fraction of risk, which was calculated for each scenario in comparison with the baseline. Simulation results show that, depending on the parameters of specific sampling strategies, both prevalence-based and concentration-based MC coupled with interventions could significantly lower risk (range of 60-88% in mean preventable fraction of risk). Overall, while the model is preliminary and subject to the stated limitations, it is likely that a combination approach including establishment-level and lot-level interventions would be highly effective in reducing risk and, therefore, benefit public health. The effectiveness of all MC was impacted by several assumptions and model parameters. In particular, the prevalence MC threshold and the concentration reduction associated with the establishment-level intervention impacted the preventable fraction of risk for Scenario 1, and the concentration MC threshold and the variability across lots impacted the risk outcomes for Scenario 2. Overall, high variance in risk outputs was observed, mainly associated with a high variance in concentration inputs. This model provides a risk-based approach to test different MC approaches for chicken parts at both lot and establishment levels, and over a wide range of scenarios of input contamination distributions, interventions, and consumer behaviors. Model estimates, as well as the ability to distinguish between variability and uncertainty, could be improved by additional data on distribution of Salmonella concentrations across and within establishments.","tags":["salmonella","food safety","chicken parts","quantitative microbiological risk assessment","microsimulation"],"title":"The Public Health Impact of Different Microbiological Criteria Approaches for Salmonella in Chicken Parts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annice Kim","**Robert F.

The number of Tweets about JUUL rose dramatically in 2015 to 2017, corresponding with the sharp increase in JUUL retail sales. Online conversations about JUUL were rarely about quitting smoking and more commonly about pods, purchasing, and use (eg, “juuling” in school). JUUL’s online advertising strategy was youth focused; they used young adult models, marketed sweet and fruity flavors, and used social media influencers to promote the brand. Youth exposure to ENDS advertising increases susceptibility to and trial of ENDS among potential new users. To date, and to our knowledge, no study has examined whether youth and young adults are exposed to JUUL marketing on social media.

Under complex designs, the amount of data available to monitor may be overwhelming and the production of reports and charts can be costly and time consuming. This is especially true in the case of longitudinal surveys, where data may originate from multiple waves. Other such complex scenarios include adaptive and responsive designs, which were developed to act on the results of such monitoring to implement prespecified options or alternatives in protocols. This paper discusses the development of an interactive web-based data visualization tool, the Adaptive Total Design (ATD) Dashboard, which we designed to provide a wide array of survey staff with the information needed to monitor data collection daily. The dashboard was built using the R programming language and Shiny framework and provides users with a wide range of functionality to quickly assess trends. We present the structure of the data used to populate the dashboard, its design, and the process for hosting it on the web. Furthermore, we provide guidance on graphic design, data taxonomy, and software decisions that can help guide others in the process of developing their own data collection monitoring systems. To illustrate the benefits of the dashboard, we present examples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). We also discuss features of the dashboard to be developed for future waves of Add Health.","tags":["survey methodology","paradata","adaptive survey design","data visualization"],"title":"Interactive visualization to facilitate monitoring longitudinal survey data and paradata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Robert F Chew**","Michael Wenger","Caroline Kery","Jason Nance","Keith Richards","Emily Hadley","Peter Baumgartner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555646400,"objectID":"53a84bc31ed67cdb2f2ebd0d13b2c14a","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/smart/","publishdate":"2019-04-19T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/smart/","section":"publication","summary":"SMART is an open source web application designed to help data scientists and research teams efficiently build labeled training data sets for supervised machine learning tasks.

As a means to develop or update household listings in LMICs, this paper explores the use of machine learning models to detect and enumerate building structures directly from satellite imagery in the Kaduna state of Nigeria. Specifically, an object detection model was used to identify and locate buildings in satellite images. In the test set, the model attained a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.48 for detecting structures, with relatively higher values in areas with lower building density (mAP = 0.65). Furthermore, when model predictions were compared against recent household listings from fieldwork in Nigeria, the predictions showed high correlation with household coverage (Pearson = 0.70; Spearman = 0.81). With the need to produce comparable, scalable SDG indicators, this case study explores the feasibility and challenges of using object detection models to help develop timely enumerated household lists in LMICs.","tags":["machine learning","deep learning","survey statistics","household listing","remote sensing","GIS","international development","sustainable development goals","computer vision"],"title":"Toward Model-Generated Household Listing in Low- and Middle-Income Countries Using Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Robert F Chew**","Annice Kim","Vivian Chen","Paul Ruddle","Antonio Morgan-Lopez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531195200,"objectID":"14a8e009c27331e2b573b55d8ee8f05a","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/digitial-ph-campaign-compute/","publishdate":"2018-07-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/digitial-ph-campaign-compute/","section":"publication","summary":"As a larger proportion of society participates in social media, public health organizations are increasingly using digital campaigns to engage and educate their target audiences.

Geosampling is a probability-based, gridded population sampling method that addresses some of these issues by using geographic information system (GIS) tools to create logistically manageable area units for sampling. GIS grid cells are overlaid to partition a country’s existing administrative boundaries into area units that vary in size from 50 m × 50 m to 150 m × 150 m. To avoid sending interviewers to unoccupied areas, researchers manually classify grid cells as “residential” or “nonresidential” through visual inspection of aerial images. “Nonresidential” units are then excluded from sampling and data collection. This process of manually classifying sampling units has drawbacks since it is labor intensive, prone to human error, and creates the need for simplifying assumptions during calculation of design-based sampling weights. In this paper, we discuss the development of a deep learning classification model to predict whether aerial images are residential or nonresidential, thus reducing manual labor and eliminating the need for simplifying assumptions.On our test sets, the model performs comparable to a human-level baseline in both Nigeria (94.5% accuracy) and Guatemala (96.4% accuracy), and outperforms baseline machine learning models trained on crowdsourced or remote-sensed geospatial features. Additionally, our findings suggest that this approach can work well in new areas with relatively modest amounts of training data. Gridded population sampling methods like geosampling are becoming increasingly popular in countries with outdated or inaccurate census data because of their timeliness, flexibility, and cost. Using deep learning models directly on satellite images, we provide a novel method for sample frame construction that identifies residential gridded aerial units. In cases where manual classification of satellite images is used to (1) correct for errors in gridded population data sets or (2) classify grids where population estimates are unavailable, this methodology can help reduce annotation burden with comparable quality to human analysts.","tags":["machine learning","deep learning","survey statistics","complex sample design","remote sensing","GIS","computer vision","international development"],"title":"Residential scene classification for gridded population sampling in developing countries using deep convolutional neural networks on satellite imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julie A Lynch","Brygida Berse","Merry Rabb","Paul Mosquin","**Robert F Chew**","Suzanne L West","Nicole Coomer","Daniel Becker","John Kautter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521518400,"objectID":"443ce05beb4eab689358ba5fc5c98da4","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/underutilization-egfr-lungcancer/","publishdate":"2018-03-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/underutilization-egfr-lungcancer/","section":"publication","summary":"Tumor testing for mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is indicated for all newly diagnosed, metastatic lung cancer patients, who may be candidates for first-line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Few studies have analyzed population-level testing. We identified clinical, demographic, and regional predictors of EGFR \u0026 KRAS testing among Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of lung cancer in 2011–2013 claims. The outcome variable was whether the patient underwent molecular, EGFR and KRAS testing. Independent variables included: patient demographics, Medicaid status, clinical characteristics, and region where the patient lived. We performed multivariate logistic regression to identify factors that predicted testing. From 2011 to 2013, there was a 19.7% increase in the rate of EGFR testing. Patient zip code had the greatest impact on odds to undergo testing; for example, patients who lived in the Boston, Massachusetts hospital referral region were the most likely to be tested (odds ratio (OR) of 4.94, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.67–14.62). Patient demographics also impacted odds to be tested. Asian/Pacific Islanders were most likely to be tested (OR 1.63, CI 1.53–1.79). Minorities and Medicaid patients were less likely to be tested. Medicaid recipients had an OR of 0.74 (CI 0.72–0.77). Hispanics and Blacks were also less likely to be tested (OR 0.97, CI 0.78–0.99 and 0.95, CI 0.92–0.99), respectively. Clinical procedures were also correlated with testing. Patients who underwent transcatheter biopsies were 2.54 times more likely to be tested (CI 2.49–2.60) than those who did not undergo this type of biopsy. Despite an overall increase in EGFR testing, there is widespread underutilization of guideline-recommended testing. We observed racial, income, and regional disparities in testing. Precision medicine has increased the complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Targeted interventions and clinical decision support tools are needed to ensure that all patients are benefitting from advances in precision medicine.

Trained human coders examined the handles’ profiles and manually categorized each as one of the following user types: individual (n=2168), vaper enthusiast (n=334), informed agency (n=622), marketer (n=752), and spammer (n=1021). Next, the Twitter metadata as well as a sample of tweets for each labeled user were gathered, and features that reflect users’ metadata and tweeting behavior were analyzed. Finally, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested to identify a model with the best performance in classifying user types. Using a classification model that included metadata and features associated with tweeting behavior, we were able to predict with relatively high accuracy five different types of Twitter users that tweet about e‑cigarettes (average F1 score=83.3%). Accuracy varied by user type, with F1 scores of individuals, informed agencies, marketers, spammers, and vaper enthusiasts being 91.1%, 84.4%, 81.2%, 79.5%, and 47.1%, respectively. Vaper enthusiasts were the most challenging user type to predict accurately and were commonly misclassified as marketers. The inclusion of additional tweet-derived features that capture tweeting behavior was found to significantly improve the model performance—an overall F1 score gain of 10.6%—beyond metadata features alone. This study provides a method for classifying five different types of users who tweet about e‑cigarettes. Our model achieved high levels of classification performance for most groups, and examining the tweeting behavior was critical in improving the model performance. Results can help identify groups engaged in conversations about e‑cigarettes online to help inform public health surveillance, education, and regulatory efforts.","tags":["e-cigarettes","social media","machine learning","tobacco control","NLP"],"title":"Classification of Twitter users who tweet about e-cigarettes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Morgan-Lopez","Annice Kim","**Robert F Chew**","Paul Ruddle"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1503979200,"objectID":"cc5e3d403d07a43c683114f9b371c2cb","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/predict-age-twitter/","publishdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/predict-age-twitter/","section":"publication","summary":"Health organizations are increasingly using social media, such as Twitter, to disseminate health messages to target audiences. Determining the extent to which the target audience (e.g., age groups) was reached is critical to evaluating the impact of social media education campaigns. The main objective of this study was to examine the separate and joint predictive validity of linguistic and metadata features in predicting the age of Twitter users. We created a labeled dataset of Twitter users across different age groups (youth, young adults, adults) by collecting publicly available birthday announcement tweets using the Twitter Search application programming interface. We manually reviewed results and, for each age-labeled handle, collected the 200 most recent publicly available tweets and user handles’ metadata. The labeled data were split into training and test datasets. We created separate models to examine the predictive validity of language features only, metadata features only, language and metadata features, and words/phrases from another age-validated dataset. We estimated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics for each model. An L2-regularized logistic regression model was conducted for each age group, and predicted probabilities between the training and test sets were compared for each age group. Cohen’s d effect sizes were calculated to examine the relative importance of significant features. Models containing both Tweet language features and metadata features performed the best (74% precision, 74% recall, 74% F1) while the model containing only Twitter metadata features were least accurate (58% precision, 60% recall, and 57% F1 score). Top predictive features included use of terms such as “school” for youth and “college” for young adults. Overall, it was more challenging to predict older adults accurately. These results suggest that examining linguistic and Twitter metadata features to predict youth and young adult Twitter users may be helpful for informing public health surveillance and evaluation research.","tags":["social media","machine learning","NLP"],"title":"Predicting age groups of Twitter users based on language and metadata features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas Peiper","Peter Baumgartner","**Robert F Chew**","Yuli P Hsieh","Gayle Bieler","Georgiy Bobashev","Christopher Siege","Gary Zarkin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499140800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499140800,"objectID":"fb1458e4b0097b35c7de99f92dff0432","permalink":"https://www.robchew.com/publication/cannabis-network-twitter/","publishdate":"2017-07-04T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cannabis-network-twitter/","section":"publication","summary":"Twitter represents a social media platform through which medical cannabis dispensaries can rapidly promote and advertise a multitude of retail products. Yet, to date, no studies have systematically evaluated Twitter behavior among dispensaries and how these behaviors influence the formation of social networks. This study sought to characterize common cyberbehaviors and shared follower networks among dispensaries operating in two large cannabis markets in California. From a targeted sample of 119 dispensaries in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles, we collected metadata from the dispensary accounts using the Twitter API. For each city, we characterized the network structure of dispensaries based upon shared followers, then empirically derived communities with the Louvain modularity algorithm. Principal components factor analysis was employed to reduce 12 Twitter measures into a more parsimonious set of cyberbehavioral dimensions. Finally, quadratic discriminant analysis was implemented to verify the ability of the extracted dimensions to classify dispensaries into their derived communities. The modularity algorithm yielded three communities in each city with distinct network structures. The principal components factor analysis reduced the 12 cyberbehaviors into five dimensions that encompassed account age, posting frequency, referencing, hyperlinks, and user engagement among the dispensary accounts. In the quadratic discriminant analysis, the dimensions correctly classified 75% (46/61) of the communities in the San Francisco Bay Area and 71% (41/58) in Greater Los Angeles. The most centralized and strongly connected dispensaries in both cities had newer accounts, higher daily activity, more frequent user engagement, and increased usage of embedded media, keywords, and hyperlinks. Measures derived from both network structure and cyberbehavioral dimensions can serve as key contextual indicators for the online surveillance of cannabis dispensaries and consumer markets over time.","tags":["social media","substance abuse","social network analysis","cannabis"],"title":"Patterns of Twitter behavior among networks of cannabis dispensaries in California","type":"publication"}]
